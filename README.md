### 1-Description :page\_facing\_up:

Need to search and find today's news quickly? Or are you looking for an article written 5 years ago? Fortunately for you this app saves you time by cutting out the 'fluff' of interned adds and superfluous information. Simply search for an article description and enter in the stat and end year (if you wish). Then view up to 5 results to save for later viewing.

That being said, I am seeming to have a much better grasp on the concepts than when I started (though I am definitely still learning).
